## Application of Biomechanical Injury Criteria in Rear-End Collision Analysis: A study on experimental data

## Overview

This code is part of a thesis conducted to complete the MSc Degree in Robotics. The study focuses on the application of biomechanical injury criteria in rear-end collision analysis, utilizing experimental data.

## Instructions

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. **Download Required Data:**
   - Before cloning the repository, download all the necessary data for analysis, as described in Chapter 4 of the thesis.
   - Rename the downloaded data to a specific format (e.g., `v01914_1993_FORD_RANGER.zip`).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. **Install Python:**
   - Ensure that Python 3.10 or 3.11 is installed on your system.

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Open a terminal and run the following command to install all the required files:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Run the Analysis:**
   - Execute the `Rear End Collision Analysis.py` script.

6. **View Results:**
   - The results will be displayed in the `result` folder, which is created by the code.

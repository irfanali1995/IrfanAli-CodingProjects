# Anthropomorphic Arm Object Manipulation

# Description
This GitHub repository showcases a MATLAB code implementation for controlling an Anthropomorphic Arm with Spherical Wrist robot. The code enables efficient picking and placing of objects. We have successfully tested and applied this code on a real robot in our lab, demonstrating its reliability in practical scenarios.

# Results: 
A GUI Based Application, in which you can put coordinates for pick and drop and see arm movement accordingly

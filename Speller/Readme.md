# CS50x Speller Project

## Project Description
This project is a solution to CS50x's "speller" problem from problem set 5. The goal of the project is to implement a spell checker that can load a dictionary of words, check the spelling of input text, and report any misspelled words. The program uses linked lists and hash tables to efficiently store and search for words in the dictionary.

## Features
- **Linked Lists:** The project utilizes linked lists data structures to store words in the dictionary, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion of words.

- **Hash Tables:** Hash tables are employed to improve the speed of searching for words in the dictionary. Hash functions distribute words across different buckets, reducing the time complexity of dictionary operations.

- **Dictionary Loading:** The program loads a dictionary file containing a list of words and builds a data structure to store these words.

- **Spell Checking:** It can check the spelling of input text by comparing each word with those in the loaded dictionary, identifying and reporting any misspelled words.

- **Performance Optimization:** The project is designed for efficiency and optimized for large dictionaries and text inputs.

## Technologies Used

- C programming language
- Linked lists
- Hash function

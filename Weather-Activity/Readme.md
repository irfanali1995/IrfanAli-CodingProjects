## Introduction

### Weather-Activity Web App
- Developed as the final project for CS50x
- Aims to suggest activities based on weather conditions
- Utilizes Python Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend

## Project Overview

### Objective
To create a web app that provides users with activity suggestions based on real-time weather data

### Technologies Used
- Backend: Python Flask
- Frontend: HTML, CSS

## Features

1. **Weather API Integration**
   - Utilized a weather API to fetch real-time weather data
   - Extracted relevant information such as temperature and description,
2. **Activity Recommendations**
   - Implemented desicion-making algorithm to suggest activities based on weather conditions i.e description and temprature 
   - Customized suggestions for different temperature ranges, precipitation, and wind speed

## Tech Stack

### Backend: Python Flask
- Chose Flask for its simplicity and efficiency
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Handled API requests and responses
- Interfaced with the database to store user preferences
### Frontend: HTML/CSS
- Developed a user-friendly interface
- Ensured responsiveness across devices for a seamless user experience

## User Interface

### Home Page
- Clean and intuitive design
- Input form for city (country optional)
### Activity Suggestions
- Dynamic display of suggested activities based on weather conditions


## Workflow

1. **User Input**
   - Users enter location and date for activity suggestions
2. **Weather Data Retrieval**
   - Backend fetches real-time weather data using the API
3. **Activity Recommendations**
   - Algorithms process weather conditions and generate personalized activity suggestions
4. **User Feedback**
   - Users receive a list of recommended activities and can provide feedback for future improvements

## Challenges

1. **API Integration**
   - Overcame challenges in parsing and extracting relevant data from the weather API
2. **Algorithm Design**
   - Developed desicion-making algorithms to ensure accurate and diverse activity suggestions based on weather conditions

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Accounts**
   - Implement user accounts for personalized activity history and preferences
2. **Expanded Activity Database**
   - Continuously update and expand the database of suggested activities
3. **Integration with Social Media**
   - Allow users to share their suggested activities on social media platforms

## Conclusion

### Reflection
- Successfully achieved the project objectives
- Gained valuable experience in web development and API integration

### Acknowledgments
- Thankful for the guidance and support received during the CS50x course

## My Contribution

As part of the Harvard CS50x Week 3 coursework, I contributed significantly to the implementation of the runoff election algorithm. Here are the key aspects of my contribution:

- Implemented the `vote` function, which records voter preferences and ensures that each vote is valid by matching candidate names.
- Developed the `tabulate` function, responsible for calculating votes given the remaining candidates, taking into account the instant runoff voting method.
- Contributed to the `print_winner` function, enabling the program to identify the winner if a candidate obtains more than 50% of the votes.
- Assisted in the development of the `find_min` function, responsible for finding the minimum number of votes any remaining candidate has and facilitating the elimination process.
- Collaborated on the `is_tie` function, which checks whether the election is tied between all candidates, leading to a tiebreak scenario.
- Participated in writing the `eliminate` function, allowing the program to eliminate the candidate(s) in last place during each runoff round.

Throughout the development process, I leveraged my C programming skills and applied algorithmic techniques to ensure the program's accuracy and efficiency in simulating runoff elections.
